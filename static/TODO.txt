http://laak.fi/category/usability/
1. Use alphabetical order for latin name: a,b,c,d
2. Use local language name near - русский
3. Place where it easy to find - header
4. If only few languages - do not hide them in the drop down menu - just print them on the page
5. Incorporate language to url

Postulates:
Navigation is not a ui-router state - navigation depends on page we are observing, it can be absolutelly different
I.e. we insert navigation as views with it's own controllers

Login/Logout is not a ui-router state too - navigation as well as other elements on page can depend on login/logout status - i.e. it's service

Login/Signup is a ui-router state, it's not a popup - expirience can be quite complex

Language selection dialog is no a ui-router state, it's close to popup... Just a way to show ui - so user can select language
