2. Use local language name near - русский

Postulates:
Navigation is not a ui-router state - navigation depends on page we are observing, it can be absolutelly different. I.e. we insert navigation as views with it's own controllers.

Login/logout status is a service - each controller, view can refer to get status and change view accordingly
